# StepByStep
## 1. Target Users & Problem Being Solved
There are already many habit-tracking apps, but they only focus on keeping track of small daily habits and the user cannot visualise why they need to repeat these every day. We thus came up with a solution that breaks down a goal into smaller habits. This way, the user can get a better idea of why they need to form certain habits. Ultimately, we believe small habits can achieve big goals *step by step*.
Because of the characteristics of our app, our target users are people who wish to set long-term goals and keep track of them. However, the app is also designed for users who need help finding and committing to their long-term goals, and even for users who wish to break down their larger goals into smaller, more attainable ones.
